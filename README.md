# First-Java-Project
This will be my first ever Project in Java using some of tools I taught myself from the past few days 
I wanna do a simple Calculator App to start things off smoothly before I start doing harder more complex projects 
My goal is to be able to build a calculator app that can perform basic functions for now 
Right now Im using the help of https://www.kennyyipcoding.com/ for my project as this is my first one and I kinda wanna follow a tutorial 
on how java really works but as time progresses and as my skills in java become more advanced I will add more details and more functions 
to make the calculator more of my own pet project for myself and for everyone else
